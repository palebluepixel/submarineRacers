World:
Enum state:
* Title
* Waiting for connections (server), connecting (client)
* Paused
* Menu1, menu2
* Loading level
* Race_start
* Race_running
* Race_finish
View *  //contains information for graphics rendering
Renderer * 
Level * //contains info on all game entities currently existent in the world 


Object Hierarchy:
GameEntity:
Position 
Name/ID
on_tick() + tick_interval
Bounding volume
orientation
Const char * type
overwrite() // on client side
get_info() //on server side, makes messages to send to client
spawn()
kill()
bool drawable
// Data only useful for Drawable entities:
* Mesh
* Textures
* render()
bool collidable
// Data only useful for Collidable entities:
* on_collide()
bool moveable // boolean flag
// Data only useful for Moveable entities:
* Velocity
* Acceleration
* Drag
* max_velocity
* max_acceleration
* Movement_handlers // set of functions


Agent: // subclass of GameEntity
Actuator  //AI or player controller
//in update, call actuator.doSteering()


Submarine: // subclass of Agent
Health / hull strength
State:
* Alive
* Dead
* Disabled (etc)
* Respawning
Air
Weapons
Turn speed
Rise / descend speed
Type








Controlling Objects (AI and User Input):
Actuator-objects associations


Handlers:
* Input
* Collision
* Tick
   * Physics
   * Render 


LoadLevel()


List of AI handlers (with tick rates) (these AI objects will have references to actuators


Actuator:
SteeringState
doSteering()        // Does steering based on SteeringState
//AI controls Actuator, Agent gets updates from Actuator
Functions that affect steering state (turn(), accelerate(), etc)


Controller:
Actuator
//Controls the Actuator
//e.g. AI and Input map should implement this




Player: (client side)
Wins
Name
Selected Sub
Control Scheme Mapping


Levels:
GameEntity[]
Sunlight
Heightmap
Color palette
Visual effects
Skybox




Rendering Info:


View:
Camera *currentCamera
Sunlight info
projectionMatrix(), etc
Eventually may contain other things like skybox and color palette which are taken from the Level class when the level is loaded. 


Renderer:
Sets uniform values
render(View *view, Entity *entity) //draws all meshes in the entity to the screen


Mesh:
Contains references to VAO and VBO objects
Color
Texture coords
Texture image
Normals
Vertex positions
draw()


In the Main loop, the renderer calls render on every game entity which should be drawn (after checking if its a drawable, frustum culling, etc), which calls the draw() function for each mesh in the entity. 








Gameplay:


Initial Screen: Choose between Server/Client mode with simple GUI.
If server: begin server.
If client: Screen to find server (IP address/port)
If successful connection: Character select in lobby with simple UI.
* Game begins when all players signal READY to server.


Game
* Players choose a particular type of nautical vehicle (submarine, sandwich, Michael Phelps, etc.), each of which has its own stats (acceleration, turn radius, arsenal, stamina, etc.)
* Submarines move along a single
